installing the fonts in X windows:

1. put the fonts in the directory where your other X windows fonts are stored
   (e.g. /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc )
2. run "mkfontdir" in the directory
3. restart xfs (X Font Server) ... under RedHat this can be done by running
   "/etc/rc.d/init.d/xfs restart", generally, if you do not find out how to do it,
   just reboot
4. try it, run e.g. "xterm -fn sabvga" and inside the xterm run e.g.
   "more boole.miz" and see if the dos-specific characters are displayed properly


to use it then in Emacs, run "M-x set-default-font sabvga"

To enter special characters inside Emacs, run "C-q xxx RET",
where "xxx" stands for ASCII code of the character.
E.g. "C-q 237 RET" enters the symbol for empty set.
Emacs can use octal, decimal and hexadecimal digits for the ASCII code,
so if you want to use e.g. decimal ASCII codes, you may need to customize
the variable "read-quoted-char-radix".
It's done e.g. this way: run "M-x customize-save-variable RET",
on prompt type   "read-quoted-char-radix RET" and then "10 RET".
