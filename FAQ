Frequently Asked Questions about Mizar Mode

Q: I have a private dictionary (*.voc file), and it can't be found
   when calling Mizar from the Mizar Mode.

A: Usually, you need to use "Toggle launch-dir" in the menu to set 
   the working directory one level up. 
   This works, if you have your article in the "text" directory and 
   private dictionaries in the "dict" directory, and "text" and "dict"
   are at the same level. 
   If you have "dict" in some nonstandard place, set the working
   directory (using "Toggle launch-dir") accordingly.


Q: What is the quick-run thing?

A: It is a workaround for the slow display in the Emacs
   term-mode. Mizar output is redirected to the *.out file, and the
   file is searched for Mizar errors afterwards.


Q: The normal (non quick-run) Mizar processing seems broken.

A: Check that the term-mode is OK. In some older versions of Emacs
   this might be the problem.


Q: Nothing works!

A: Try running Mizar in shell (using the "mizf" script). If no
   success, read the README for Mizar distribution.


Q: Some things in the Hide/Show menu do not work as they should.

A: Get the latest hideshow.el from 
   http://www.glug.org/people/ttn/software/hideshow/


Q: Various things seem broken in XEmacs.

A: Yes, it should not be much work to make it XEmacs compatible.
   Care to do some?
